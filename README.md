# React app - Financial Balance

This app is a part of the React School 4 month course completed in 2021. The current consists of four sections: financial balance, finance form, incomes and expenses. It is a simple react-hook-form which helps you to calculate your own budget.

In the future, I intend to extend the project into a full-stack version with backend and MondoDB database. I will also add authentication, so that everyone can create an account and keep track of their personal balance.
